### Hey, I'm Matthew!

🛩️ I'm an aviation embedded systems software engineer at Leidos.

⚾️ I previously was an R&D Data Scientist with the Cleveland Guardians, using neural networks and deep learning to assess players.

👨‍🎓 I have Ph.D. in deep learning for [smart manufacturing](https://manufai.engr.uky.edu) from the University of Kentucky

🎉 Some of my previous NASA work has been open sourced at https://github.com/nasa/CTF/tree/master/tools/ctf_ui

🎓 Check out my recent paper [Maximizing Model Generalization for Machine Condition Monitoring using Self-Supervised and Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14398) that was accepted for publication in *Journal of Manufacturing Systems*. (See the rest of my papers at https://mruss.dev/papers)

💬 Talk to me about software architecture, deep learning, Python, software engineering, or space
